Hue Voice
=============

### Control Your Philips Hue lighting system the way it was meant to be...according to every sci-fi writer. Ever.

While still a work in progress, the current generation allows you to control individual or themes of lights using voice commands. Adjust the color, the theme, or on/off status with normal human phrases. For example: "Turn the bedroom light blue." or "Turn off the desktop lamp."

Manual control of lighting is also possible through a slick neon skinned interface. This interface allows full control over each light making it possible to adjust saturation, brightness, and effects.

### Future Additions

* Integrate with Google Now to allow always-on type usage for basement bars, office lobbies, or anywhere else you may use an Android tablet for automation.
* Build out extensive voice command library
* Allow for users to create their own keywords for colors and themes

## What Was Used

* Ionic Framework
* AngularJS
* Philips Hue API
